Hello,

I encountered an issue when:

**Provide here exact steps and/or minimal code chunk to reproduce the issue**

Pug-Symfony version: **PUT HERE YOUR PUG-SYMFONY VERSION (exact version, not the range)**

PHP version: **PUT HERE YOUR PHP VERSION**

I expected to get:

```
Put here expected result
```

But I actually get:

```
Put here the current error/output you get instead
```

Thanks!
